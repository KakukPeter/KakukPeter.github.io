        <h2>Notable achievements</h2>
        <h3> <i>Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve Classic Race Champion</i></h3>
        <p> In my spare time at Wald's Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed. Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human. Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.</p>
        <h3><i>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects</i></h3>
        <p>During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large
capital construction projects for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance
testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating Alderaan - a terrestrial
class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire
power of the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing
both projects to <div id ="exp">run-away</div> photon torpedoes.</p>
